# Contributor Guidelines

You should always follow the project specification at specs.md and the roadmap at
ROADMAP.md.

- Ensure that all code is correctly formatted always.
- Ensure it passes lint tests and reformat if needed.
- The CI workflow must run lint, typecheck, format, build, and test steps.
